    <h3 id="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</h3>
    <p> Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, although occupies third place in the global market share of browsers, is known to be more secure and faster than the most widely used PC Browser i.e. Chrome.

    Firefox has recently added a new feature that saves you from getting tracked while you work online. Firefox now protects you from Supercookies, which stay hidden in your browser and keep tracking your information – this is huge merit and takes Firefox to first place in the list of top 10 browsers.<br>
        Features:
    <ul><li> Pop a video out of the browser window so that you can stream and multitask.</li>
        <li>Expanded dark mode</li>
        <li>An extra layer of protection.</li>
        <li>Search everything with a unified search bar.</li>
        <li>Customize the menu or toolbar.</li>
        <li>fast and free.</li>
        <li>New tab page having great content at your fingertips.</li></ul></p>
        <p> Firefox implements many web standards, including HTML4 (almost full HTML5), XML, XHTML, MathML, SVG 1.1 (full),[74] SVG 2 (partial),[75][76] CSS (with extensions),[77] ECMAScript (JavaScript), DOM, XSLT, XPath, and APNG (Animated PNG) images with alpha transparency.[78] Firefox also implements standards proposals created by the WHATWG such as client-side storage,[79][80] and the canvas element.[81] These standards are implemented through the Gecko layout engine, and SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine. Firefox 4 was the first release to introduce significant HTML5 and CSS3 support.<br>
           
        Firefox has passed the Acid2 standards-compliance test since version 3.0.[82] Mozilla had originally stated that they did not intend for Firefox to pass the Acid3 test fully because they believed that the SVG fonts part of the test had become outdated and irrelevant, due to WOFF being agreed upon as a standard by all major browser makers.[83] Because the SVG font tests were removed from the Acid3 test in September 2011, Firefox 4 and greater scored 100/100.<br>  
            
        Firefox also implements "Safe Browsing,"[86] a proprietary protocol[87] from Google used to exchange data related with phishing and malware protection.<br>
            
       Since version 38 on Windows Vista and newer, Firefox supports the playback of video content protected by HTML5 Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). For security and privacy reasons, EME is implemented within a wrapper of open-source code that allows execution of a proprietary DRM module by Adobe Systems—Adobe Primetime Content Decryption Module (CDM).<br> CDM runs within a "sandbox" environment to limit its access to the system and provide it a randomized device ID to prevent services from uniquely identifying the device for tracking purposes. </p>

    <h3 id="Google Chrome">Google Chrome</h3>
            <p>  Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. It is a fast and easy-to-use web browser. Chrome lets you browse and navigate the net while using less data just by turning on Chrome’s data saver. It also lets you browse without saving your browsing history, using the incognito mode. <br>

                Features:
            <ul><li>Fast browsing.</li>
               <li>Data saver.</li>
               <li>Let’s you download to view offline.</li>
               <li>Keeps your phone safe by showing warnings when you attempt to navigate through a dangerous site.</li>
               <li>Voice search option.</li>
               <li>Translate text on your screen.</li>
               <li>Smart personalized recommendations.</li>
               <li>Privacy.</li>
                <li>Sync across devices.</li> 
            </ul></p>
            <p> The browser was first publicly released, officially as a beta version,[31] on September 2, 2008 for Windows XP and newer, and with support for 43 languages, and later as a "stable" public release on December 11, 2008. On that same day, a CNET news item drew attention to a passage in the Terms of Service statement for the initial beta release, which seemed to grant to Google a license to all content transferred via the Chrome browser.[32] This passage was inherited from the general Google terms of service.[33] Google responded to this criticism immediately by stating that the language used was borrowed from other products, and removed this passage from the Terms of Service.    </p> 

            <p>Chrome was assembled from 25 different code libraries from Google and third parties such as Mozilla's Netscape Portable Runtime, Network Security Services, NPAPI (dropped as of version 45),[44] Skia Graphics Engine, SQLite, and a number of other open-source projects.[45] The V8 JavaScript virtual machine was considered a sufficiently important project to be split off (as was Adobe/Mozilla's Tamarin) and handled by a separate team in Denmark coordinated by Lars Bak in Aarhus. According to Google, existing implementations were designed "for small programs, where the performance and interactivity of the system weren't that important", but web applications such as Gmail "are using the web browser to the fullest when it comes to DOM manipulations and JavaScript", and therefore would significantly benefit from a JavaScript engine that could work faster.   </p>

 <p> Microsoft Edge is the default web browser on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Windows 11, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, replacing Internet Explorer 11 and Internet Explorer Mobile.[27] As its development and release is dependent on the model of Windows as a service, it is not included in Windows 10 Enterprise Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) builds.[28][29][30]

Microsoft initially announced that Edge would support the legacy MSHTML (Trident) browser engine for backwards compatibility, but later said that, due to "strong feedback," Edge would use a new engine, while Internet Explorer would continue to provide the legacy engine.
    
Favorites, reading list, browsing history and downloads are viewed at the Hub,[32] a sidebar providing functionality similar to Internet Explorer's Downloads manager and Favorites Center.
    
Edge features a PDF reader,[34] and supports WebAssembly. Until January 2021, Edge also featured an integrated Adobe Flash Player (with an internal whitelist allowing Flash applets on Facebook websites to load automatically, bypassing all other security controls requiring user activation).</p>

       <p> Opera Mini is a mobile web browser developed by Opera. It was primarily designed for the Java ME platform, as a low-end sibling   for Opera Mobile, but it is now developed exclusively for Android. It was previously developed for iOS, Windows 10 Mobile, Windows Phone 8.1, BlackBerry, Symbian, and Bada. As of 2018, the Android build is the only version still under active development.Opera Mini was derived from the Opera web browser. Opera Mini requests web pages through Opera Software's compression proxy server. The compression server processes and compresses requested web pages before sending them to the mobile phone. The compression ratio is 90% and the transfer speed is increased by two to three times as a result. The pre-processing increases compatibility with web pages not designed for mobile phones. However, interactive sites which depend upon the device processing JavaScript do not work properly.</p>
